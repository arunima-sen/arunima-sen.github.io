**Position Estimation and Subpixel Accuracy in Tracking Particles from Images:** I investigated the phenomenon of pixel locking, an error that limits the tracking accuracy of experimental outputs to a much lower resolution than is desired. Existing algorithms to track particles infer subpixels with a systematic error known as pixel locking, a phenomenon that biases the positions of particles towards certain locations, thereby limiting the tracking accuracy of experimental outputs to a much lower resolution than is desired. The objective of the project was to train a machine learning model to track the centers of particles with better precision to reduce the pixel locking error.

**All isn‚Äôt unbiased in Climate and Violence Reportage:** We studied media bias in the climate crisis. The study backs up the media-created barriers that inhibit the public from having a more comprehensive awareness and grasp of socio-political events. Our conclusion was that misinformation is one of the factors that shape the trajectory of discourse on climate change. Echo chambers‚Äîcombined with confirmation bias and polarization‚Äîexacerbate the exposure to climate misinformation.

**Podible** Created a solution to effectively combat malnutrition among expectant mothers and children under the age of five in India. Podible is a cheap but impactful dissolvable nutrient pod that acts as an effective supplement to meals. The pod, cased in monosol, contains nutrients (like iron, omega 3, and folate) required by children under the age of five and caretaking mothers. Also created a distribution algorithm that creates an index that determines which states need the most funding to tackle malnutrition.

**Predictive Analytics for Barley Yields** We analyzed the relationship between barley yields in the United States and climate change factors using open data and data analysis techniques and devised a solution using IoT and data science to increase yield. Developed a system for farmers to use data-backed decisions to maximize yields. The solution implements IoT which uses sensors and internet connectivity to gather and analyze data.
