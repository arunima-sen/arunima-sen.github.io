## Spatial Thinking and Modelling

In this course, spatial concepts, models, and GeoAI applications are explored to address geographic problems through lectures, hands-on exercises, and self-study. 


### A Spatial Simulation Approach to Model Grazing Dynamics on Vierkaser Pasture, Austria

Co-authors: Beatriz Peres, Marcelo Rigoto

This study applied spatial simulation to model grazing dynamics on the Vierkaser pasture, Untersberg, Austria, using geospatial data from drone imagery and manually digitized maps provided by Professor Gudrun Wallentin. The pasture was classified into distinct zones based on vegetation and soil characteristics, aiming to analyze cow movement influenced by managerial decisions and determine the maximum sustainable number of cows for ecological balance and profitability. 

 
A grid-based simulation in the GAMA (GIS and Agent Based Modelling) software incorporated Agent-Based Modelling for cow behaviour and Cellular Automata for grass growth. The GAMA simulation analysed the balance between grazing and regrowth, and the results identified a sustainable number of cows.
