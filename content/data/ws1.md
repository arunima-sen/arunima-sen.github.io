## Digital Earth: Big Earth Data Concepts

### Temporal Analysis in Google Earth Engine 
In this project, I visualized the devastating impact of the 2018 Camp Fire on Pulga, California. Using Sentinel-2 imagery from before and after the fire, my objective was to effectively highlight the extent of the damage, particularly the burn scars and vegetation loss. 

Here's a false-color visualization showing the area before and after the fire, showing the damage:

## Geo-Humanitarian Action

In this course, the role of geospatial technologies in modern humanitarian action, from disaster response to conflict prevention, was examined. The topic I chose for my final presentation was *Geo Data for Disaster Preparedness* and here, you can see the ArcGIS StoryMap I used for my presentation:

## Spatial Thinking and Modelling

In this course, spatial concepts, models, and GeoAI applications are explored to address geographic problems through lectures, hands-on exercises, and self-study. 


### A Spatial Simulation Approach to Model Grazing Dynamics on Vierkaser Pasture, Austria

<u>Co-authors</u>: Beatriz Peres, Marcelo Rigoto

This study applied spatial simulation to model grazing dynamics on the Vierkaser pasture, Untersberg, Austria, using geospatial data from drone imagery and manually digitized maps provided by Professor Gudrun Wallentin. The pasture was classified into distinct zones based on vegetation and soil characteristics, aiming to analyze cow movement influenced by managerial decisions and determine the maximum sustainable number of cows for ecological balance and profitability. 

 
A grid-based simulation in the GAMA (*GIS and Agent Based Modelling*) software incorporated Agent-Based Modelling for cow behaviour and Cellular Automata for grass growth. The GAMA simulation analysed the balance between grazing and regrowth, and the results identified a sustainable number of cows.
