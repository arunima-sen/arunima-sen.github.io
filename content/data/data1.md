## Analysis and Modeling (Remote Sensing) 
This seminar was structured into four phases: Image acquisition, pre-processing, analysis, and delivery, emphasizing hands-on experiments and comparative methodological studies. My project focused on Pansharpening, where I implemented and compared four classical Component Substitution methods—Brovey, PCA, IHS, and Gram-Schmidt—using urban imagery from the PAirMAx dataset put forth by Vivone et al. (2021). I conducted quantitative and visual evaluations of the methods’ ability to enhance spatial detail while preserving spectral information. All algorithms were implemented in Python within a Jupyter Notebook. My seminar paper, titled *A Comparative Analysis of Pansharpening Techniques for Very High Resolution Satellite Imagery* can be found below.
